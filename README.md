## About Me : 
I am motivated to build solutons that helps accelerate science. I enjoy building intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning, data engineering, and human-centered interfaces. My projects focus on designing and implementing scalable pipelines and interactive applications that translate complex data and models into accessible tools for scientific exploration and decision-making.<br>
<br>
Through hands-on work in areas such as multimodal retrieval, deep learning, and applied AI systems, I aim to enhance how science and technology interact—by creating robust implementations that support discovery, interpretation, and real-world impact. I am particularly motivated by projects that bridge theory and practice, enabling advanced algorithms to be deployed in meaningful and usable forms.
